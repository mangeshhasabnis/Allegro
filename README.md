# Allegro

This repository contains the code that I wrote while learning game programming with Allegro 5. 


DISCLAIMER: The artwork used in the code is not created by me. I use it only for the purposes of focusing on coding instead of art work. If you think the artwork you created is in this repository and if you feel it needs to be taken down let me know.
